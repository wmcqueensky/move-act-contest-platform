						What is the The Move&Act Photo-Voice Contest?
					</Accordion.Header>
					<Accordion.Body>
						The Move&Act Photo-Voice Contest is part of the Erasmus+ project
						"Move & Act- Empower Youth through Entrepreneurial and Digital
						Skills" This initiative aims to develop digital, creative and
						entrepreneurial skills among young people, especially those who are
						at risk due to disabilities, migration status or as NEETs (Not in
						Education, Employment, or Training). The contest provides a platform
						for participants to express their challenges and experiences through
						photography, thereby improving their employability, fostering a
						European identity and encouraging interaction with the local,
						national and European community.
					</Accordion.Body>
				</Accordion.Item>

				<Accordion.Item eventKey="1">
					<Accordion.Header>Purpose of the Contest</Accordion.Header>
					<Accordion.Body>
						Photo-Voice is a qualitative research method that combines
						photography and storytelling to document and address social issues.
						This method was developed in the 1990s by Caroline Wang and Mary Ann
						Burris and enables communities to share their experiences and make
						their voices heard. Participants are invited to take photos that
						reflect their experiences, challenges or perspectives on specific
						topics such as poverty, unemployment, education, environmental
						issues and more. These photos will be accompanied by narratives that
						contextualise the images and provide deeper insight into community
						issues.
					</Accordion.Body>
				</Accordion.Item>

				<Accordion.Item eventKey="2">
					<Accordion.Header>Themes of the Contest</Accordion.Header>
					<Accordion.Body>
						Participants must submit photos that fit one of the following
						themes:
						<ul>
							<li>Poverty</li>

							<li>Unemployment</li>

							<li>Education</li>

								Environment (protection and/or degradation of biodiversity)
